## **Icecream's Escape (C++ OOPs Project)**
**A 3D escape room game built in C++ for Object Oriented programming project**

### **Game Overview**
**Icecream** (you) locked in a mysterious room by **Milkshake**. Explore the room, collect keys, solve puzzle and escape the room.

### **Feature Set**
*This is an immersive 3D puzzle experience played from a first-person perspective, featuring mouse-look navigation. 
Players must utilize an inventory to manage collected items and solve environmental challenges to achieve the final win state.      

*The system utilizes standard first-person 3D movement and mouse-look. Mechanics include an inventory for tracking interactive 
object interaction (keys, notes, doors, chests) and a code puzzle.

### **Controls**
*W/A/S/D - Move forward/left/backward/right

*Mouse - Look around (first-person view)

*E - Interact with objects

### **Objective**
The objective is to escape the room by obtaining the final Gold Key for the exit door. This requires the player to first explore the environment 

to find and collect two initial items: the Red Key (on the table) and the Blue Key (on the floor). 

Clues for the code lock puzzle (1842) are found by reading notes. Once the code is entered, the player uses the Blue Key to open a chest

which contains the required Gold Key needed for the final escape.
